.00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:04,089
Hello there and welcome again and this video. I

2
.00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,740
wanted to talk about how to clean hay piles and

3
.00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:12,109
especially for the beginner students to make sure that they

4
.00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:15,490
follow certain rules that will produce clean have files.

5
.00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,070
In the end now, I started off with the

6
.00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,440
messy have filed that I myself did. And as

7
.00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,600
you can see, it's It's still quite organized,

8
.00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,780
and I'll explain, why is that? But there's

9
.00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,530
a lot off tightening that we could do. There's

10
.00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,850
a lot of cleaning and organize reorganizing that we could

11
.00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,299
do here, but overall, it's still clean.

12
.00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,429
Now the trick for this is to always use Merge

13
.00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:45,500
, knows when when notes can be grouped together.

14
.00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,850
So, for example, this is creating an ark

15
.00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,380
, and this is creating a pillar on grouping these

16
.00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,899
two together. And then that goes along with a

17
.00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:59,030
ground piece or something else. And the main structure

18
.00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,250
that I use is to always have a spine,

19
.00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,420
and you can look at you can see it here

20
.00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:06,579
there is a spine, and this is the same

21
.00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,700
thing that I use for nuke as well. And

22
.00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,609
this is where I learned it from because I did

23
.00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:14,879
a lot of compositing, and it's best to do

24
.00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,659
is find where you have starting point or whatever data

25
.00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,129
in New York the use of read file and you

26
.00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,200
start with the data and then you continue continuously plug

27
.00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,700
in data from left and right. This is a

28
.00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,930
practical for procedural modeling. It works really well.

29
.00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,180
In other examples where you have pyre or things like

30
.00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,650
that. Most set ups and stops are quite easy

31
.00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,939
for destruction. We have to use this structure.

32
.00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,750
We have to prepare and organize things like this.

33
.00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,310
And this file is quite Messina. I'm going to

34
.00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,019
show the cleaned up version of this and you can

35
.00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,640
see clearly that there is a spine. And if

36
.00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,599
there is other sections, those sections themselves will have

37
.00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,250
spine structure. And the trick is to use merchants

38
.00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,000
to combine smaller spines. And then the merge profoundly

39
.00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,460
does not have more than three unless you've really need

40
.00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,180
toe, because that's going to conclude things. Now

41
.00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,259
if something that I always do, if I need

42
.00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:21,259
this input somewhere here instead, off using a wire

43
.00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,020
, I would create a knoll here and call this

44
.00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,069
out and then use an object merch and give them

45
.00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,139
the same color. So this'll will be explained,

46
.00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,689
obviously to students. But when you get a file

47
.00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,080
, and especially in the beginning and there is a

48
.00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,120
lot of mess, it's best to I believe that

49
.00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,689
as it is and then clean it up. See

50
.00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,889
, that's why I don't like drug block dropped back

51
.00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:55,490
backdrops, Um, and and then I'm going to

52
.00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,750
use this node to, let's say, go in

53
.00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,479
here, for example. So now I have instead

54
.00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,180
of having why're intersecting with everything that will make the

55
.00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,259
visual really bad, I use an object merge,

56
.00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,810
and I know that this one is linked to this

57
.00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,060
one. And, um, and I think that's

58
.00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:19,360
pretty much it for for beginners. If you'll receive

59
.00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,210
a file that is really bad, it's best to

60
.00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,199
keep what they have done and then copy everything and

61
.00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,870
recreated. If the set up is quite complex,

62
.00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,169
you don't have to do the entire set up again

63
.00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,830
, just a small section so they can understand what

64
.00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,460
the process is again. I have each workshop each

65
.00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,460
of these fundamental beginning workshop. They will have enough

66
.00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,409
information in them to guide them as to how to

67
.00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,280
structure things. But this is something that I highly

68
.00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,699
encourage you guys to do to make sure that their

69
.00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,169
files are easy clean, and they can go back

70
.00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,689
to come back to it and probably work on them

71
.00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,490
. Or it's not hard to remember now, backdrops

72
.00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,490
I don't like and I'm not gonna encourage people to

73
.00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,150
your spec drops. It just used it to illustrate

74
.00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,210
how it would look like. But what I don't

75
.00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,259
like is with backdrops, you cannot expend No,

76
.00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,169
As you saw, I added note. And then

77
.00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,750
it made this whole thing bigger. I only use

78
.00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,470
flat. I never used backdrops. If I need

79
.00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,540
to name something, I would add either a backdrop

80
.00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:27,560
or a sticky note and give it a color if

81
.00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,430
I need to and then se test whatever. Now

82
.00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,449
, another thing that I like to do is to

83
.00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:40,439
add backdrops like this next to an area, and

84
.00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,009
then they create like a in the index. So

85
.00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,269
at the top, I would copy these like this

86
.00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,050
and say OK, anything with this color is going

87
.00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,279
to be pillars, okay? Or if you're working

88
.00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,889
in destruction, anything that is red means Sim Sim

89
.00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,240
note or anything that is purple. You can use

90
.00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,000
whatever coloring you need. A studios have have this

91
.00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,529
already so same that say this is out. Ah

92
.00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,540
, lot of student or most studios have terminology for

93
.00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,009
what each type should be color with with. And

94
.00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,199
that's pretty much it for cleaning up piles. They

95
.00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,379
should look nice. They should be easy to read

96
.00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,800
and have always a structure, some sort of structure

97
.00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,180
in them. Thank you, guys and talk to
