Hey, guys! And welcome. So our goal

2
.00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,990
is to have 5 to 70 eights, depending on

3
.00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,380
how much we can afford and how much ah support

4
.00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,039
we need. We are hoping to expand in the

5
.00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,649
near future, and we want to start this now

6
.00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,579
with maybe for people available to support the upcoming session

7
.00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,789
, or at least the first to set two sessions

8
.00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:31,109
off 2020 LaGrone. We're going to add more people

9
.00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,729
, and then we're going to have a specific channel

10
.00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,799
or a specific group here called Affects Ta and under

11
.00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:42,869
underneath that group will have each person have their own

12
.00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:45,880
channel. The reason for that is because we wanna

13
.00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,270
have the placeholder. If anybody wants to ask you

14
.00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,250
something or they have question, they can, they

15
.00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,350
can do that. It will be a public channel

16
.00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,109
off course, and also it's nice to see that

17
.00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:02,390
here, because people will be able to say,

18
.00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:06,260
Okay, we have 70 ace hose online. Who's

19
.00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,849
connected? This is for journey. This is for

20
.00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:12,680
Kevin and or Husam, and we can tell people

21
.00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,290
can see who's online and they can ask questions.

22
.00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:19,969
They're guaranteed they will get support and Pete back,

23
.00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,859
and that's pretty much it feel free to use the

24
.00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,319
session, this channel to ask any question. Or

25
.00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,010
if you have any ideas on how to improve things

26
.00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,480
or if you have any suggestions. Or if you

27
.00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,120
want to mess with Igor, your role more than

28
.00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,620
welcome to do that. Thank you, guys.

29
.00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:40,719
And best of luck to all of us. Talk
