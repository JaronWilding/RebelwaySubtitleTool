.00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,459
Hello, everyone. And welcome to the introduction to

2
.00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,879
Houdini for effects artists. My name is savage jealousy

3
.00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,109
, and I'm gonna be your instructor for this course

4
.00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,179
. I wanted to record this video to explain the

5
.00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:15,769
content off the workshop and how it is structured and

6
.00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,230
how you Gates can get the most out of this

7
.00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:22,449
out of this content. And throughout the course,

8
.00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,289
we're going to be talking about a variety of topics

9
.00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,609
. This'll starting with the particle simulation we're going to

10
.00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,130
then move on to learn about fluids and smoke simulation

11
.00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,060
in Houdini. And then we're going to learn destruction

12
.00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,369
as well as fluid towards the end. In between

13
.00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,929
, all this were also going to learn a variety

14
.00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,689
of techniques to render particles volume and use mantra to

15
.00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,229
render geometry. No, Uh, every time we

16
.00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,280
progress, every week we progress. We're gonna acquire

17
.00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,950
new knowledge. Every week is somewhat linked to the

18
.00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,989
previous week. So it's going to be very important

19
.00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,329
to follow along consistently and study the material off every

20
.00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,769
week. Because by the time we get too weak

21
.00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:15,359
, five or four, if you haven't thoroughly followed

22
.00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,049
the first the beginning of the workshop, it's gonna

23
.00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,209
be hard to catch up at that time, and

24
.00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:26,849
the way things structured is we're going to first get

25
.00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,079
introduced to Houdini and how it works. We're going

26
.00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,480
to start slow on easy in the first week to

27
.00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,659
get everyone to the same level that we need to

28
.00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,620
be able to fully understand what's coming next. Now

29
.00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,930
I know a lot of few guys are also very

30
.00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,780
comfortable with Houdini. There is also people from a

31
.00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,140
students from the three D artist workshop, so this

32
.00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,829
the first week is going to be an introduction that

33
.00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,590
hopefully gets everybody at the same level. The most

34
.00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,280
event. The more advanced user may find it a

35
.00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,209
little bit repetitive, but it is required so that

36
.00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,879
we can make sure that everybody, including the the

37
.00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,659
newly beginners, can comfortably get started with Houdini and

38
.00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:15,409
don't miss on any any valuable information. So we're

39
.00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,710
going to start in the first week by acquiring how

40
.00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,180
to use the application, have to navigate through teeny

41
.00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,680
how to use opponents and things like that, and

42
.00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,810
then we're going to learn about particles, create various

43
.00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,370
particles. Now, as we acquire more knowledge,

44
.00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,110
for example, once we understand how fluid silver the

45
.00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,099
smoke's over works. We're going to be able to

46
.00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,150
create more complex particle since so at that time,

47
.00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,039
we're going to go back and create something a bit

48
.00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,629
more complex in terms off part possum on. Then

49
.00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,379
, as we progress, we're going to learn how

50
.00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:47,289
to do destruction, for example, and create a

51
.00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:51,159
lot of moving GM tree. ATTN. That time

52
.00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,770
is well, we're going to reuse the particle knowledge

53
.00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,009
from the first weeks to recreate some degrees in some

54
.00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,719
dust falling and things like that as well as create

55
.00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,969
smoke for the for the effects and on down,

56
.00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,039
we're going to learn about fluids and create Whitewater,

57
.00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,849
which is also a particle based in Houdini. So

58
.00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,080
there is a lot of intersection between these topics now

59
.00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,030
. The effects, the particle based section, which

60
.00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,550
is these guys here and there is there is more

61
.00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,930
is individual projects that you can reuse or you can

62
.00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,639
enter great in any environment. And the goal is

63
.00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,569
I don't want you guys to be re copying what

64
.00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,389
exactly I'm gonna be doing. I want you guys

65
.00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:38,610
to try and explore these techniques that I'm going to

66
.00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,349
be showing you gonna be. It's gonna be a

67
.00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:45,370
lot of new stuff and a lot of techniques that

68
.00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,860
can create a variety of different effects. And I

69
.00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,900
highly encourage you guys to try and and do that

70
.00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,449
rather than just recreating what I'm showing in the videos

71
.00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,949
, because thes techniques are very, very flexible,

72
.00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,500
and they can do much more than what I'm going

73
.00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,310
to show you. So hopefully with all these examples

74
.00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,509
, you guys will acquire enough knowledge that should buy

75
.00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:08,639
the end, get you very, very, very

76
.00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,930
comfortable. Working with Houdini stops dynamics rigid body fluids

77
.00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,040
as well as rendering everything using mantra like volumes and

78
.00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,730
particles and things like that. So thank you so
